		<h3>Biograpy</h3>
		<p>I am Yuze Fu, a dedicated second-year student at the University of Toronto Scarborough, pursuing an Honors Bachelor 
		of Science with dual specializations in Mathematics and Computer Science. My academic journey is driven by a passion 
		for problem-solving and a strong foundation in programming, particularly in C and Python. My experiences range from 
		winning a prestigious award in the National Olympiad in Informatics to developing creative solutions through 
		hackathons. Beyond academics, I have honed my skills in data analysis, front-end development, and even 3D modeling. I 
		am continuously expanding my knowledge in these areas and am particularly interested in applying this knowledge to 
		real-world problems, as evidenced by my participation in projects like developing a mentorship matching system for 
		university freshmen. With a CGPA of 4.0, I am committed to excellence and am eager to contribute to innovative projects 
		that bridge the gap between technology and practical application.</p>
