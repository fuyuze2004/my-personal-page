		<hr><hr><h2>About me</h2>
		<img src="images/my-photo.jpg" alt="My photo" width="283" height="290">
		<p>My name is Yuze (or Lucas), a third-year student in University of Toronto. I double 
			majored in mathematics and computer science, aiming for a PhD degree in the future. Currently, I am 
			interested in algebraic number theory and probabilistic graph theory. Also, I am keen on bridging 
			real-world problems with abstract theories by using machine learning.</p>
		<p>"读万卷书，行万里路。 -- 司马迁 《史记》" This sentence is from a Chinese history book writen 2000 years ago, 
			meaning that True wisdom is born from the union of deep knowledge gained through study and profound 
			understanding earned from real-world experience. Travelling is a must of my every holiday.
		<p>Gaming also plays an important role in my life. I mainly play two types of game: sandbox and rpg. My 
			favourite sandbox game is <i>Minecraft</i> which accompanies me since 2012. <i>Legend of Zelda: Breath of 
				the Wild</i> is my best rpg game forever, still fascinating me time after time (I replay the whole 
				game at least 5 times).

		<h3>Machine Learning-Driven NSI Forecasting for Toronto Neighborhoods <a href="documents/CSCC11_Final_Report_Group1.pdf">
		<button>Report</button></a></h3>
		<p><i>November 2025</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tools Used: </strong>Python, sklearn, PyTorch, SARIMA, Latex (for report)</li>
			<li>Developed predictive models for monthly neighborhood safety using 100K+ crime records, achieving 0.0527 RMSE
(best) through LSTM architecture that captures 12-month temporal patterns across 159 Toronto neighborhoods</li>
			<li>Engineered Neighborhood Safety Index (NSI) using severity-weighted crime aggregation and temporal features
(lagged values, rolling averages) to transform raw incident data into actionable safety metrics</li>
			<li>Compared 6 ML approaches (Ridge, KNN, FNN, LSTM, SARIMA) through systematic hyperparameter tuning; LSTM
achieved 82.95% R² while Ridge Regression provided interpretable coefficients for policy applications</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Virtual Memory and File System Implementations for Operating System</h3>
		<p><i>May - July 2025</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tools Used: </strong>C, Pintos, Docker</li>
			<li>Threads: Used Multilevel Queue Scheduling and Priority Donation to optimize Context Switching</li>
			<li>User Programs: Implemented all basic system calls triggered by interrupts through Stack</li>
			<li>Virtual Memory: Created Supplemental Page Table, Frame, Swap and Eviction Algorithm to support paging</li>
			<li>File System: Chosed Multilevel Indexed File to support flexible file operation and implemented Directory</li>
			<li>Sychronization: Tried both Lock and Semaphore to deal with different situations</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Firefighters - Assembly Platform Game <a href="https://github.com/fuyuze2004/Firefighter">
		<button>Repo</button></a></h3>
		<p><i>April 2025</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tools Used: </strong>Assembly, Computer Organization, MARS</li>
			<li>Move the firefighter to save injured people withoug touching the fire, and approach the exit as you can</li>
			<li>Implemented Bitmap for display, MMIO Simulator for input</li>
			<li>Actively used registers for efficient operation, and stack for function calling</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Linux OS Monitoring Tool & FD Table Creator <a href="https://github.com/fuyuze2004/System-Monitoring-Tool">
		<button>Repo 1</button></a> <a href="https://github.com/fuyuze2004/OS-FD-Creator">
		<button>Repo 2</button></a></h3>
		<p><i>April 2025</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tools Used: </strong>C, Linux, System Programming</li>
			<li>Demonstrated real-time RAM usage, CPU usage by line charts and File Descriptor table</li>
			<li>Captured information from Linux OS files and created diagrams, such as reading CPU usage time from "/proc/stat",
then calculating the real-time usage into 100%, and plotting onto the chart</li>
			<li>Implemented pipes to enhance the performance by concurrency, and reinstalled signal handlers to fit the needs</li>
			<li>Modular codes with the use of makefile, and detailed documentation including README and docstring</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Fungi Image Classification & Denoising <a href="https://github.com/A-Skvortsov/DS3-Datathon-2025">
		<button>Repo</button></a></h3>
		<p><i>March 2025</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tools Used: </strong>Python, PyTorch, CNN</li>
			<li>Developed a classifier achieving 93.8% accuracy on a 5-class, 3,000+ image fungi dataset using GPU acceleration.</li>
			<li>Implemented a denoising autoencoder with transposed convolutions to preprocess corrupted images.</li>
			<li>Built a custom data pipeline with augmentation for memory-efficient loading and batch processing.</li>
			<li>Performed noise analysis and statistical characterization to optimize preprocessing and enhance performance.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Irrigation System 
		<a href="documents/Automatic Lawn Sprinkler Irrigation System.pdf">
		<button>Report (Chinese)</button></a></h3>
		<p><i>July 2021</i></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tools Used: </strong>Python, KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor), Barrel distortion correction, OpenCV</li>
			<li>Engineered a smart sprinkler system using a KNN machine learning model (Python, OpenCV) to analyze lawn
images and enable targeted, water-efficient irrigation.</li>
			<li>Achieved 80%+ accuracy in classifying lawn hydration levels by processing RGB image data and implementing
grid-based analysis.</li>
			<li>Designed end-to-end system architecture from image capture to sprinkler control.</li>
		</ul>
